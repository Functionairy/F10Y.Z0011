Example path and path-part values.


## Rules

- Raw values use the N_### convention (as opposed to N### or N_## or _####).
	- Sub-numbering is allowed: N_###\_##\_#
- Every value should be a raw value somewhere.
	- But you do not need to double-raw (take a raw path and make it a raw directory path, which is then made a directory path).
- All paths start as IPaths, but are then segregated into descriptive sets (like Windows paths).
- Set element orderings should be alphabetic.
	- But regions are allowed (and should be alphabetically ordered, with contents alphabetically ordered).
- By default, directory paths should be directory indicated.
